defmodule Broadway.Acknowledger do
  @moduledoc """
  Defines a behaviour used to acknowledge that the received messages
  were successfully processed or failed.

  When implementing a new connector for Broadway, you should implement this behaviour
  and consider how the technology you're working with handles message acknowledgement.

  The `c:ack/2` callback must be implemented in order to notify the origin of
  the data that a message can be safely removed after been successfully processed and published.
  In case of failed messages or messages without acknowledgement, depending on the technology chosen,
  the messages can be either moved back in the queue or, alternatively, moved to a _dead-letter queue_.

  Invoked to acknowledge successful and failed messages.

    * `successful` is the list of messages that were successfully processed and published.
    * `failed` is the list of messages that, for some reason, could not be processed or published.
