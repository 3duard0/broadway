# Using custom producers

## Working with standard GenStage producers

In general, producers must generate `%Broadway.Message{}` structs in order
to be processed by Broadway. In case you need to use an existing GenStage
producer and you don't want to change its original implementation,
you'll have to set the producer's `:transformer` option to translate the
generated events into Broadway messages.

### Example

In the following example the producer is a regular GenStage, i.e., it
produces plain events that cannot be processed by Broadway directly.
By using a transformer, you can tell Broadway to transform all events
generated by the producer into proper Broadway messages.

    defmodule Counter do
      use GenStage

      def start_link(number) do
        GenStage.start_link(Counter, number)
      end

      def init(counter) do
        {:producer, counter}
      end

      def handle_demand(demand, counter) when demand > 0 do
        events = Enum.to_list(counter..counter+demand-1)
        {:noreply, events, counter + demand}
      end
    end

    defmodule MyBroadway do
      use Broadway

      alias Broadway.Message

      def start_link do
        Broadway.start_link(__MODULE__,
          name: __MODULE__,
          producers: [
            default: [
              module: Counter,
              arg: 1,
              transformer: {__MODULE__, :transform, []}
            ],
          ],
          processors: [
            default: [stages: 10]
          ],
          batchers: [
            default: [stages: 2, batch_size: 5],
          ]
        )
      end

      ...callbacks...

      def transform(event, _opts) do
        %Message{data: event}
      end
    end

Pay attention that if you need to send acknowledgement information
back to the producer you'll need to set the `:acknowledger` field
when creating the message.

    defmodule MyBroadway do
      use Broadway

      alias Broadway.Message
      @behaviour Broadway.Acknowledger

      ...

      def transform(event, _opts) do
        %Message{data: event, acknowledger: {__MODULE__, event.id}}
      end

      def ack(successful, failed) do
        # Do whatever you need here...
      end
    end
